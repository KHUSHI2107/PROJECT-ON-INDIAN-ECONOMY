INDUSTRIAL PROJECT ON INDIAN ECONOMY USING BUSINESS ANALYTICS
**ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**- I am very thankful to my Business Analytics Supervisor, Dr. Swapnil Soni for his continuous help and guidance in the preparation and completion of my project on INDUSTRIAL PROJECT ON INDIAN ECONOMY USING BUSINESS ANALYTICS. It were the interesting lectures of my knowledgeable teacher which have helped me to understand the various type of Business analytics and excel tools caveats" analyze and relate them with the real industry process and growth. This project is submitted as a part of Vocational training included in the curriculum of AICTE for Bachelors of Technology of computer science and engineering course.  
I would also like to thanks Dr. Siddhartha Choubey for continuous support and guidance and helping me being a better engineering. I would also like to thank my CSE department providing such an interesting opportunity to see the practical approach and application of the concepts learned outside the classroom. I could clear my doubts and understand the application of concepts while collecting and analyzing the data. This has developed greater interest in the subject. 

**Abstract-**

Business analytics (BA) is a set of disciplines and technologies for solving business problems using data analysis, statistical models and other quantitative methods. It involves an iterative, methodical exploration of an organization's data, with an emphasis on statistical analysis, to drive decision-making. 
Data-driven companies treat their data as a business asset and actively look for ways to turn it into a competitive advantage. Success with business analytics depends on data quality, skilled analysts who understand the technologies and the business, and a commitment to using data to gain insights that inform business decisions.  
This project has been explicitly made on Indian economy keeping the increment/decrement of Indian GDP in mind. Indian economy has always been a roller coaster ride it goes up and down as per the rate of change of different sectors. There are several sectors whose targeted audience, investment, need, capital required, employability rate, expenses, raw material, machinery required, impact on GDP, energy consumption, labor productivity etc. are extremely different to each other therefore, the protocols are set differently for each of them.


**INTRODUCTION-**
 
**ABOUT YOUR PROJECT-** How business analytics works? Let’s roll in…  Determine the business goal of the analysis. 
* Select an analysis methodology. 
* Get business data to support the analysis, often from various systems and sources. 
* Cleanse and integrate data into a single repository, such as a data warehouse or data mart. 
 
Initial analysis is typically performed on a smaller sample data set of data. Analytics tools range from spreadsheets with statistical functions to complex data mining and predictive modeling applications. Patterns and relationships in the raw data are revealed. Then new questions are asked, and the analytic process iterates until the business goal is met. 
 
This project has been explicitly made on Indian economy keeping the increment/decrement of Indian GDP in mind. Indian economy has always been a roller coaster ride it goes up and down as per the rate of change of different sectors. There are several sectors whose targeted audience, investment, need, capital required, employability rate, expenses, raw material, machinery required, impact on GDP, energy consumption, labor productivity etc. are extremely different to each other therefore, the protocols are set differently for each of them. We have used the official data drafted by Indian government from 1981 to 2016 which covers many periods wherein we observed recession, depression and also inclination and sudden increment in few sectors based on which we were able to interpret different inferences and make quality decision based on the our inferences.   

**Tools and Technology used-**
Different types of business analytics include the following: 
* descriptive analytics, which tracks key performance indicators to understand the present state of a business; 

* prescriptive analytics, which uses past performance to generate recommendations for handling similar situations in the future. 

* predictive analytics, which analyzes trend data to assess the likelihood of future outcomes; and 

Some schools of thought also include a fourth approach, diagnostic analytics, which is like descriptive analytics. It analyzes the state of a business and diagnoses why certain events or outcomes happened. 

**Data Visualization-**

A picture is worth 1000 words; Let the numbers speak!! 
 
* Visualization is the graphical presentation of information, with the goal of providing the viewer with a qualitative understanding of the information contents.  
* Understanding may involve detection, measurement, and comparison 
 
What makes a good visualization? 
* Effective
* Accurate 
* Efficient 
* Aesthetics 
* Adaptable 

* **Limitation**-
Can't produce a correct numerical figure from many of the plots.

Homogeneity in the units of measurement is important (should not plot speed of 2 bikes with 
2 different units).

Difference of opinion in conclusion about plots.
